# Minecraft Mod - Codename : ELN

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/50b9dd17ce574d53b0432741b08b257d)](https://app.codacy.com/app/jrddunbr/ElectricalAge?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jrddunbr/ElectricalAge&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Electrical Age (ELN) is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale in-game electrical simulations.

Look at the official project website [electrical-age.net](https://electrical-age.net/) and [the Wiki](http://wiki.electrical-age.net/) to get general information. More dedicated documentation on the way soon!

This is a fork of Electrical Age maintained by Jared Dunbar (jrddunbr), with the intent to add features and push for active development. It includes all the features from the [upstream Electrical Age repository](https://github.com/Electrical-Age/ElectricalAge/).

## How to get started

**ElectricalAge is Minecraft 1.7.10 compatible only. Forge build 1614 is needed.**

1. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/jrddunbr/ElectricalAge/releases) page on GitHub for the latest stable build.

2. Download the latest build, and add the jar to your launcher. Be sure that you are using Forge 1.7.10, revision 1614.

3. Launch, and have fun!

## ABOUT

Here is some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behavior similar to those of real life objects.

Multiple electrical machines and components
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...

Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.

Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...

Small and big electrical consumers
> From lamps and electrical furnaces to miners and transporters...

Incredible tools
> X-Ray scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Interoperability
> Old redstone circuits can be exploited with electrical <-> redstone converters.

Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...
